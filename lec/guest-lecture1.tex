\me{The lecture was on supersymmetric field theory.
There were a lot of details that I don't want to transcribe, but the highlights were:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Series expansions of fields in anticommuting variables are finite, which greatly simplifies things.
    \item While you \emph{can} split a superfield into bosonic and fermionic parts, you probably shouldn't, because it gets complicated. 
\end{itemize}
